monorepo method

babel and react

 instead of
separating packages out and two
different repos and two basically
different folder structures and whatnot
you put everything into one


why????


you
can share dependencies and we'll talk
about that in a second and two you can
very easily share code between the
packages

package.json

{
	"private":true,
	"worspaces": ["client", "server"]
}


folder and packages


yarn init -y


module.export = () => {
}


graphql yoga


commonFunction = require("common")

commonFunction ()

dependencies

common 1.0.0


yarn install 
to link the dependncies
