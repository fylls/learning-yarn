# NPM vs Yarn | Which is the best Package Manager?

</div>

---

Yarn is a new js package manager developed and used by facebook in production

**Why?** solves problems with npm:

- faster
- more secure
- peer dependency resolution
- offline mode
- resolves issues around versioning
- strict guaranteed
- supports emojis

**5-10 times faster than npm on every single package installed**
**But** yarn takes more space o the disk and has a smaller community

yarn stores dependencies on global cache so you can install it offline
`yarn.lock` lists of all exact dependencies versioning
